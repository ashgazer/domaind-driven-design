🧑‍💻 How these all fit together
Imagine you’re writing Python for an online shop in memory only:
Entities: Customer, Order


Value Objects: Money, maybe Address


Aggregates: Order as root, with OrderItems


Repository: OrderRepository (keeps Orders in memory)


Service: DiscountService (logic spanning multiple orders)


Factory: OrderFactory (simplify creation)


Bounded Contexts: /orders, /payments, /shipping


Your Domain Model is the sum of all of these.

⚡ So, you’ve got the essentials:
Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates (the “what”).


Repositories, Services, Factories, Bounded Contexts, Ubiquitous Language (the “how” and “where”).
